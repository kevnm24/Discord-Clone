## Discord Clone

This program starts off with a login page with google authentication. Once you log in it will pull info from your google account such as your name, profile picture, and gives you a unique user id which you can all see on the bottom left corner. If you wish to log out just click your profile image and you will be redirected to the log in page.

Chat rooms are on the left, you can click on any of them and be able to chat in real-time using the text field on the bottom. You are also able to create new chat rooms by clicking the plus icon and name it whatever you want. The rest of the icons are for visuals only.
